The rebellion spearheaded by the enigmatic homunculus leader, Mikaelis Agnito, leaves Eve as the last surviving member of her imperial lineage, massacred in the name of freeing the oppressed homunculi from tyrannical subjugation.\n\nEve, a staunch advocate for homunculi rights, had steadfastly rejected the tradition of binding a homunculus as her loyal knight. Disowned by her family, she garners the attention and respect of Mikaelis, who spares her life and envisions a shared reign. However, Eve's sister, Rosenitte Nadia, driven to madness by her past ownership of Mikaelis, tragically betrays Eve. In the aftermath of this betrayal, Mikaelis, consumed by guilt, resolves to rewrite fate at any cost to revive Eve.\n\nWith a sudden leap back in time seven years, Eve alone retains the memories of the grim past. Empowered by this foreknowledge, she realizes she must actively contend for the throne against her treacherous kin to secure a future of harmony. To avert an impending tragedy, Eve must defy her previous stance and appoint a personal knight—the formidable and rebellious homunculus, Mikaelis.",

When high schooler Yuuji Itadori stumbles upon the desiccated finger of the fearsome Curse Sukuna Ryoumen, his world is upended as he is thrust into this violent conflict.\n\nIn a bid to defend himself from a malevolent Curse drawn to the finger's dark energy, Yuuji brashly absorbs its power, gaining strength to combat Curses but also setting free the vengeful Sukuna. Despite containing Sukuna within himself, Yuuji is branded a perilous Curse by the Jujutsu community, marked for extermination.\n\nAs Yuuji faces his fate of execution, he encounters Satoru Gojou, a mentor from Jujutsu High School, who reveals a risky alternative.

To achieve this, Yuuji must consume all of Sukuna's remaining fragments, ensuring the demon's eradication upon his own death. Embracing this opportunity to safeguard the world and extend his own life, Yuuji enrolls in Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School, plunging into a brutal and unforgiving battleground.",

The late Count's son swiftly agrees, altering Rieta's fate from sacrifice to consort. Embracing her new role, Rieta, skilled in magic, uses her powers to bless those within the castle walls.\n\nAmidst her newfound duties, Rieta delves into understanding the Archduke, who, in an unexpected twist, shows her kindness in a world devoid of it.

In my final moments, resigned to the end, I closed my eyes, believing all was lost. Yet, as I opened them once more, I found myself inexplicably transported back in time to a world unfamiliar and altered.\n\nPerplexed by my changed circumstances, I questioned the absence of my once-potent mana and the stark transformation of the grand castle into a humble wooden abode. To my astonishment, I discovered a surprising truce between the dragons and humankind, a reality at odds with the past I knew.\n\nWith a fallen family teetering on the edge of collapse and the ancient art of divination vanished, I faced a new existence devoid of mana. Determined to navigate this mysterious realm, I resolved to carve a different path for myself.\n\nThus begins the tale of the esteemed hero from the esteemed swordsman clan, embarking on a journey through time to a parallel world fraught with enigmas.",
